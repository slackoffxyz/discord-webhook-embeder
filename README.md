# Discord Reaction Message Embed Tool
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f51ab24b-f291-435b-bb96-c287ea9c89f5/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/lucid-montalcini-a31399/deploys)

Easily create formatted "react to this message" embeds via a Discord webhook.

Emotes will be displayed, but for that to work, you need to paste(not type) an emote code in. A Discord emote code contains the name and ID of a discord emote, and looks like this: <:myemote:234567891234567890>

This will allow you to use any emotes you have access to in your embeds.

## Getting emote codes
Retrieving emote codes is a little more difficult, as Discord does not provide a quick easy way to copy the internal emote code(<:name:id>).

I've done so with the help of a bot I created.
Simply find the bot on Discord and DM it the command `/emote (emote here)`, like so:
